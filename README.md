# tal-zipkin
[Zipkin](http://zipkin.io) is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the [Google Dapper paper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html). Zipkin allows you to see the how long the whole operation took, as well how much time was spent in each service.

This project includes a dependency-free library and a [spring-boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) server. Storage options include in-memory, JDBC (mysql), Cassandra, and Elasticsearch. This repo are the Python wrappers we can use to trace Takealot services.

## Quick-start

The quickest way to get started is to fetch the [latest released server](https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.zipkin.java&a=zipkin-server&v=LATEST&c=exec) as a self-contained executable jar. Note that the Zipkin server requires minimum JRE 8.

# Implementation Overview

Web requests are served by [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) routes, and tracing is automatically performed for you by [pyramid_zipkin](https://github.com/Yelp/pyramid_zipkin).

## Setup

Before you start anything, you'll need to download the libraries:
```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

Start zipkin as a Docker container.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
